# CloudBees CI Scripts
This is a small repository of scripts (Groovy and otherwise) that I've
developed to cover various needs within the CBCI world.

## Supportability
This repository makes no claims to supportability and provides no
warranty of any kind. Use at your own risk. I've done what I can to
test that they won't brick a system, but still be cautious when
using them.
